# Hardware Enablement Sample Operator

The Hardware Enablement Sample Operator is an example of a Kubernetes
[Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/), which uses the
[Kernel Module Management Operator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kernel-module-management) to
manage [out-of-tree](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt) kernel modules in
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get
a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster. **Note:** Your controller will
automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster
`kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```shell
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/he-sample-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```shell
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/he-sample-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```shell
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```shell
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state
is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```shell
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```shell
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```shell
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
